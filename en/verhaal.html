        <h1>The Story of the Deposit Bin</h1>
        <p>Chances are, you've seen the StaGeBa around somewhere. Whether it's yellow or orange, the deposit bin is helping more and more municipalities stay clean and tidy.</p>
        <p>Deposit schemes significantly reduce litter. However, millions of euros in deposit money still end up on the streets or in trash bins each year. These trash bins are then rummaged through, causing even more waste to end up on the streets.</p>
        <p>This can be improved; and so two young artists - Pablo Cantatore and Antonius Janssen - came up with the idea of the deposit bin.</p>
        <p>They are appearing in more and more municipalities across the Netherlands. The StaGeBa provides the convenience of not having to go to the store to return your bottle, while ensuring the deposit money goes to a good cause.</p>
        <p>The bottom of the bin is equipped with a flap that anyone can open. This makes it easy for deposit collectors to empty the bins without having to break into other trash bins. It also reduces the workload for the municipality, as other trash bins fill up less quickly and thus need to be emptied less often.</p>
        <p>The StaGeBa promotes a cleaner city, reduces waste of money, and makes the lives of deposit collectors a bit more humane. Do you think this is a good idea? Share this page or learn how you can contribute!</p>
